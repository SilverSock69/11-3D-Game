# 11-3D-Game
This is a 3D game made using Godot.
In this game it will imitate popular games like "Flappy Bird" and you have to keep going in an unlimited run
You try not to touch the bars you are in between on the top and bottom of you
If you touch them you should die
Keep going and get your highest score!

Made for my MSCH-220 Game Technology class
